HOW TO GET STARTED

The basis and most difficult part of Vietnamese are the tones and pronunciation.

You will be learning about Diphtones, Triphtones and vowels that exist in no other language and some rather strange consonants too.

This can make learning Vietnamese quite intimidating at the beginning.

Even when you know a word, chances are that native speakers still will not understand you because you do not pronounce it correctly yet.

The good news is that once you get past this, things get a lot easier. Vietnamese grammar is much less of a headache than Japanese, Spanish or Russian.

So just get your head down, take your time to learn the tones and pronunciation and do not get frustrated when you struggle.

Everyone does. You will get through it and the sun shines much brighter on the other side once you get there.
