- What is it
  - Mood disorder
  - Chronic condition causing intense mood changes
- Who does it affect?
  - 1 in 50 Aussies
  - Onset: teens/young adults
  - Women > men
- Characterised by
  - Periods of extreme moods
    - **Manic (hypomanic) episodes**
      - Extreme euphoria, high
      - Can be high-functioning
      - Hypomania is 'less than mania'
    - **Depressive episodes**
      - Hopelessness, low energy
    - Can last weeks or months
- Symptoms (direct quote[^healthdirect])
  - During a *manic phase*, symptoms may include:
    - feeling high, extremely happy or irritable
    - inflated self-esteem or grandiose ideas
    - increased energy, activity and creativity, along with a reduced need to sleep
    - an increase in task-focused behaviours (such as staying up all night to get things done)
    - racing thoughts and speech (may be expressed as frequently talking over people) jumping from topic to topic
    - being very easily distracted by any stimuli (such as noises or other people)
    - impulsive or risky behaviours with spending, business or sexual activity
    - unrealistic plans, delusions or hallucinations
  - During a *depressive phase*, symptoms may include:
    - low mood
    - lack of motivation
    - a loss of interest in usual leisure activities or hobbies
    - changes in sleep patterns
    - difficulty concentrating
    - withdrawing from social contact and activities
    - feelings of worthlessness or guilt, which may include [suicidal thoughts](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/warning-signs-of-suicide)
- Types
  - **Bipolar I**
    - long-lasting periods of extreme mood (either mania or depression)
    - can include psychosis
  - **Bipolar II**
    - less-extreme highs (hypomania)
    - episodes last for a few hours/days
  - Cyclothymic disorder
    - less severe, still impacts daily function
  - Substance-induced bipolar disorder
- Causes
  - Here it will be made clear why I have an irrational fear about developing bipolar disorder.
  - Genetics
    - 1 parent with bipolar -> 1 in 10 chance of child
      - [someone I know] has bipolar disorder (I., I think)
      - [someone else I know] had bipolar disorder (definitely I., it was quite severe)
    - 2 parents -> 4 in 10
  - Chemical imbalances
  - Triggers
    - HEEHHEHEE yeah this is another place that worries me
      - I have a pretty bad combo of risk factors
        - [someone I know] is prob clinically depressed
        - my ACE score is pretty high/I had a traumatic childhood
        - family conflict is high
        - constant resurfacing of trauma and hardship in my life, it seems
        - general anxiety can be quite high
          - anxiety attacks do occur but they're not too common and they're not really panic attacks
    - 'Women who are predisposed to bipolar disorder may experience their first episode while they are pregnant or after they have their baby.'
      - my JAW DROPPED when I read this
- Treatment
  - Initial
    - medications, individualised
  - Ongoing
    - with the aim of preventing relapse and improving quality of life
    - medications
      - antidepressants (short period, only should be combined with bipolar-specific mood stablisers)
      - lithium, [someone] takes this and so did [someone else]
      - anticonvulsants
      - antipsychotics, in particular Risperidone sticks out bc [someone I know] has taken it...
  - Therapy
- Prevention
  - no guarantee (yay)
  - be aware of early warning signs
    - inform friends and family
  - avoid substances
    - incl caffeine (luckily I don't drink coffee, take that [my coffee addicted friends] and other coffee enthusiasts in my life)
  - stress management
  - sleep
- Complications
  - can become more severe without treatment
  - high risk of other health issues
