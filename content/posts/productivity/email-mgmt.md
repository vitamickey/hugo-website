## Tiago Forte - One touch to inbox zero[^1]

- calendar
- task manager, archive
  - I've just added Todoist to my Gmail suite so hopefully that makes my life easier
- note taking
  - Evernote is recommended but I don't really like it.
- read it later
  - Now using Instapaper

The setup Tiago outlines is nice, and I've followed almost all of it. BUT I like setting up auto label filters so I CAN go back and find things. I still do use the email like a file storage system, because 1. I really don't have files that need storing THAT often, and 2. they're not normally useful for me to move to a file mgmt system. I probably should tho. Maybe they will become to-do's, and I'll put them in Gdrive.

### When you check your email

1. Open Gmail
2. Open the oldest email in your inbox
3. Decide what needs to be done about it and do one of the following:
    1. Archive (“e” shortcut) immediately
    2. Reply (“r”), then archive
    3. Add to calendar, then archive
    4. Create a task (“add task” shortcut), then archive
    5. ~~Send to Reference app, then archive.~~ I think I will add to my to-do list to file in gdrive instead.
    6. Send to Read Later app (“f”), then archive

Forward everything to Gmail because its features are better.[^2]
