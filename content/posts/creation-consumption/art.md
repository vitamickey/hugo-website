### BATS

Bat art. Purchased as part of Project 4 Awesome 2022. My first perk. Created by Taylor Behnke, and powered by Gatorade. It's a lino print with a diagonal peach to deep lavender gradient and happy little bats. It's so cute look at the little baby bats AGH.

{{< figure src="/img/art/bat-by-taylor-behnke.jpg" alt="A small group of cute bats flying in front of a moon." caption="Bat Art by Taylor Behnke" >}}

This has a close connection to the beginning of my journey into [[Linguistics]]. At the start of this year (2022), I watched Crash Course Linguistics, hosted by Taylor Behnke, to get a taste of linguistics before my uni semester started. This year, I took my first linguistics course at uni, which I just barely missed the intake for last year. When the 2022 P4A rolled around, I tuned in, and it just so happened that Taylor Behnke was hosting a few hours of the stream. The event also closely coincided with me starting my linguistics course. So, what better way to spend my money than to support a charity event that excites me than buying a piece of art which also commemorates a turning point in my linguistics journey?

### Fruit stickers

I can't remember why it came up, but I remembered that fruit labels are cool. Here are links, roughly in order of discovery:

This collection is absolutely bonkers and I love it. I wish @fruit_stickers had a catalogue this robust.
